/**
 * dsh-boot-animation — browser half.
 *
 * Seating:
 *   - `shell.overlay`          the frame-wide floating layer for the animation
 *   - `sidebar.footer.action`  the pin toggle and the picker button, beside Settings
 * Both are list slots, so each is an added cell, never a replacement.
 *
 * NO STATIC `inject`, deliberately. A static dependency the host cannot satisfy
 * leaves this plugin's fiber PENDING forever, and the web boot treats ANY entry
 * that is not `active` as fatal — it throws `web boot: N entry did not activate`
 * and the entire GUI fails to load. That happened in the field:
 *
 *   dsh-boot-animation: pending (waiting for service: uisession)
 *
 * A cosmetic intro animation must never be able to cost someone their harness, so
 * both services are resolved through cordis's dynamic injection: the wait happens
 * in a CHILD fiber and this entry activates immediately. On a host that never
 * provides them, the plugin silently does nothing — the correct failure mode for
 * an add-on like this one. `scripts/verify-client-boot.mjs` asserts the invariant.
 *
 * Everything below `apply` is the store and the controllers; the decisions
 * themselves are in `store.ts` and, on the host, `clip-resolver.js`. This file
 * only wires them to slots.
